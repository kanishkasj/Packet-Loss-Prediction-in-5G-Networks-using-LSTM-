Packet Loss Prediction in 5G Networks using LSTM

Overview

This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict packet loss in 5G mmWave networks. By analyzing time-series data such as round-trip time (RTT), congestion status indicators, and channel characteristics, it addresses the challenges of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) impairments and environmental disruptions. The system aims to enhance network performance by enabling accurate packet loss predictions for better resource allocation and seamless connectivity.

Features

Time-Series Analysis: Uses LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies in 5G network data.

Key Input Features: Analyzes RTT, congestion indicators, channel average difference, and other network parameters.
